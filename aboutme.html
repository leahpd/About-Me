	<p> I don't like potatos or computer science. I am a senior in high school. I am Brazilian🇧🇷, Puerto Rican🇵🇷, and Cuban🇨🇺. NO, I do NOT speak Portuguese nor Spanish. I was born in New York. I have 2 jobs. I work at Citi Field and I'm a waitess. I love hoodies. My favorite season is fall.🍂 I'm excited for Halloween and Christmas because those are my favorite holidays.🎃🎄🎅👻 </p>

	<p> My favorite color is lavender.💜 I am an Aquarius. I want to go to Disney World but that's money.🐭 I want to graduate. I hate school. I like shopping.🛍 I have two brothers. One is my brother from the same mother and the other one is my brother from another mother. I live with my dad. My mom is an artist and fashion designer🎨✍🏼and my dad works in a muffin factory. I don't like being home, I'm always hanging out with friends👯 or working. I need 12 hours of sleep a day or else I don't function right.😴 I love singing and listening to music.🎤🎧 My favorite singer is Ariana Grande.💓 I love watching movies.🍿</p>

	<p> This summer I had a job at Citi Field.⚾️ I was a parking greeter so I said hi to people and gave the directions to places around the stadium. That was pretty boring because I did nothing most of the time and my break was 3 hours. I also got a job as a waitress at a pizzeria.🍕 I answer phones and take people's orders. The pay is pretty trash but it's like 2 blocks away from my house. I also got my driver's license this summer.🚗 I want to major in film and production in college.🎬</p>

	<h2>Technology 😅</h2>
	<p> I use my phone and my mac.📲💻 I use Instagram and Snapchat on a daly basis.</p>
